## The python script challenge.py allows users to convert temperature and volume

### Temperature can be converted between kelvin, celsius , fahrenheit and rankine

### Volumes can be converted between liters , tablespoons , cubic-inches, cups , cubic-feet and gallons


### Here's how to use the script to convert temperature:

```
1.python3 challenge.py

2.You wil get prompted with the following question: Do you want to convert temperature or volume?
    valid answer is: temperature
3. Next you will be prompted for the temperature type?
    Valid answers are: kelvin, celcius , fahrenheit and rankine (case sensetive)
4. Next you will be prompted for the numberical value of the temperature you'll like to convert from
5. Next you will be prompted for the temprature you'll like to convert your input to
